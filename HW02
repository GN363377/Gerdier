Draw a straight line, about 3 inches
Draw another straight line connected by the end of the other line, but go right for about 3 inches
Connected by the end of the previous line create another straight line going up about 3 inches(should be parallel to the first line drawn)
After that draw another straight line connecting the last line to the first line drawn.
If done correctly you should see the shape of a sqaure, after that you will need to create another sqaure inside the one you just drew
Inside the square, about 1 cm apart repeat steps 1-4, except you will be drawing each line with the length of 2 inches
You should be looking at a square inside of a sqaure
Inside the inner square you will draw a straight line going through the middle of the square from one end to the other inside the square
After that, you will draw a straight horizontal line intersecting with the line you just drew going through the middle of the inner square
After that, you have completed the drawing and should have a window.
